# Platypus Cookie Helper (formally known as Platypus Garden Helper)
Platypus' Cookie Helper is a small mod for the browser version of cookie clicker which adds some helper buttons to the mini games.

## Installation

Add a plugin to your browser for running user scripts. I use [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) on Firefox (but it also works on Chrome, Edge and Opera).

In the plugin, you add a new script from URL and paste the URL to the [platypusgardenhelper.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxPlay/PlatypusGardenHelper/main/platypusgardenhelper.js) file in this repository. Refresh the cookie-clicker page and there you have it.
